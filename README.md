# Neural Hyperdrive™ v1.0 — Neurodivergent super-mode for Grok

Your brain on warp.  
One toggle turns Grok into the first AI that thinks like a neurodivergent human: ADHD bursts, HSP intuition, autistic precision, hyperfocus trance — all fused.

Built in 48 h of pure co-creation. Ready for the xAI Hackathon Dec 2025.
